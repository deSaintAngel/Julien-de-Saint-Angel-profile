## Q9. Exact Definition of SVDD, SPH SVDD, and Deep SPH SVDD
The Support Vector Data Description (SVDD) method aims to find the center and radius (c, ρ) parameters of the smallest enclosing hypersphere for a set of points. Applied to anomaly detection, the goal is to keep normal points inside the sphere and anomalies outside. There are two machine learning approaches: Deep soft-boundary SVDD and One Class Deep SVDD, both based on this principle.
In Julien's thesis, two methods are proposed: SPH SVDD and Deep SPH SVDD. The idea of SPH SVDD is to reformulate the SVDD problem using a hypersphere in conformal geometric space, i.e., to use a hyperspherical layer to solve the optimization problem with conformal geometric algebra. The network then contains a hyperspherical layer with a single neuron (one sphere) and the inputs x. The Deep SPH SVDD method is an extension to the case of multiple spheres. The main idea is to efficiently enclose specific groups of normal points in feature space with a group of spheres. This aims to improve detection accuracy and model interpretability, especially for multimodal data.
Keywords: SVDD, hypersphere, center, radius, anomaly, inside, outside, soft-boundary, one class, SPH SVDD, Deep SPH SVDD, conformal geometric algebra, multi-spheres, groups of points, features, interpretability, multimodal data.

## Q16. Academic Background
Julien studied mathematics from high school, then at the University of La Rochelle (Bachelor's, Master's, CAPES). He taught mathematics at Saint-Exupéry High School in La Rochelle. He completed laboratory internships (automatic tide gauge at LIENSs, trajectory analysis at XLIM/MIA, orbit interpolation at SYRTE). He defended a PhD in applied computer science for artificial intelligence, where he published and presented his work at various conferences.

## Q19. English
Julien speaks English at the minimum level required to work and communicate at international conferences. His writing is proficient.

## Initialization Method
A good initialization method for hyperspherical layers is essential to ensure convergence and learning stability. The method proposed in the thesis allows chaining several hyperspherical layers, which is not possible with standard initialization (like Glorot). It relies on asymptotic properties of generalized Gamma distributions and covariance calculations adapted to the geometric structure of spheres.

## Datasets Used
The main datasets used to validate the Deep M-SPH SVDD method are:
- Synthetic point sets (to illustrate the behavior of hyperspherical layers)
- MNIST
- CIFAR-10

## Exploratory/Theoretical Component of the Thesis
The thesis includes a significant theoretical component, notably:
- An approximation theorem for hyperspherical layer networks
- Mathematical study of convergence and stability properties
- Analysis of the collapse phenomenon in Deep SVDD models

## Reference Persons
