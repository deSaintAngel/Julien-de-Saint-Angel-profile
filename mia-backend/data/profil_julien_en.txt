Scientific Definitions and Clarifications:

Hyperspherical Neural Networks (HSN):
A hyperspherical layer network is a neural network where each neuron defines a hypersphere in the data space, enabling nonlinear and compact separation. Unlike classical dense layers, which separate space with hyperplanes (linear decision), hyperspherical layers separate with hyperspheres, offering a more flexible decision boundary suited to complex structures.

Distinction from Dense Layers:
Dense (fully connected) layers perform linear separations (hyperplanes) in feature space, while hyperspherical layers perform nonlinear separations (hyperspheres). This allows better capture of complex data structures and improves anomaly detection.

Importance of Initialization in HSN:
The initialization of parameters (center and radius of hyperspheres) is crucial to ensure signal propagation through multiple hidden layers and learning stability. Julien has proposed a specific initialization method adapted to these architectures.

Ambitions and Perspectives:
Julien aims to continue his research in artificial intelligence, particularly in applying AI to medical image analysis and environmental issues.
