Exact Definition of SVDD, SPH SVDD, and Deep SPH SVDD\n\nThe Support Vector Data Description (SVDD) method aims to find the center and radius (c, ρ) parameters of the smallest enclosing hypersphere for a set of points. Applied to anomaly detection, the goal is to keep normal points inside the sphere and anomalies outside. There are two machine learning approaches: Deep soft-boundary SVDD and One Class Deep SVDD, both based on this principle.\nIn Julien's thesis, two methods are proposed: SPH SVDD and Deep SPH SVDD. The idea of SPH SVDD is to reformulate the SVDD problem using a hypersphere in conformal geometric space, i.e., to use a hyperspherical layer to solve the optimization problem with conformal geometric algebra. The network then contains a hyperspherical layer with a single neuron (one sphere) and the inputs x. The Deep SPH SVDD method is an extension to the case of multiple spheres. The main idea is to efficiently enclose specific groups of normal points in feature space with a group of spheres. This aims to improve detection accuracy and model interpretability, especially for multimodal data.\nKeywords: SVDD, hypersphere, center, radius, anomaly, inside, outside, soft",

Unlike classical dense layers, which separate space with hyperplanes (linear decision), hyperspherical layers separate with hyperspheres, offering a more flexible decision boundary suited to complex structures.\n\nDistinction from Dense Layers:\nDense (fully connected) layers perform linear separations (hyperplanes) in feature space, while hyperspherical layers perform nonlinear separations (hyperspheres). This allows better capture of complex data structures and improves anomaly detection.\n\nImportance of Initialization in HSN:\nThe initialization of parameters (center and radius of hyperspheres) is crucial to ensure signal propagation through multiple hidden layers and learning stability. Julien has proposed a specific initialization method adapted to these architectures.\n\nAmbitions and Perspectives:\nJulien aims to continue his research in artificial intelligence, particularly in applyin",

These models use the conformal representation to directly learn the centers and radii of hyperspheres enclosing normal data.\nDeep M-SPH SVDD combines several hyperspheres to model subgroups of normal behaviors.\nExtensive experiments are presented on 2D synthetic data, MNIST, and CIFAR-10, with study of the parameter ν, performance metrics (AUC-ROC, AUC-PR, F1-score), and stability with respect to the “collapse” phenomenon observed in classical Deep SVDD.\nResults show that hyperspherical layers provide better robustness and superior detection power while remaining interpretable.\n\nAppendices:\nThe appendices provide additional mathematical and technical details:\nA: calculation",
